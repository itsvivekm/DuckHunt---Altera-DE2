DuckHunt is a classic game which became very popular when it was first introduced by Nintendo. This is an 
implementation of the game using Verilog and Arduino on a Altera DE2 Board (FPGA) with an accelerometer as the primary input.

This game is designed to work with three forms of inputs:
1. Accelerometer
2. Keyboard
3. DE2 controls

The range of inputs can be easily extended without any modifications in the existing code.
